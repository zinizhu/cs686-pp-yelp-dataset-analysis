# Yelp Dataset Analysis With BigQuery & Data Studio


## Introduction
This is the personal project for CS686 Data Processing in Cloud. In this project, a series of data analysis are conducted based on Yelp's public dataset. The analysis
focused on three aspects: Yelp's development, businesses advertised on Yelp, and Yelp's users.

## Data Source
Data is from Yelp's public [dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset).

## Tools
In this project, [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) is used to conduct data analysis. 
[Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/navigation/reporting) is used to visualize data. 
Both tools are from [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).

## Report
This repo contains both the analysis report and the pdf version of the Data Studio report. 

You can access the Data Studio report [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/80025518-5668-4c47-bf95-c036206182af).

You can access the Google Doc Report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BMYKYGo20di85DMqQMgAKP3KtNgYdko8W4vg7AtwCYk/edit?usp=sharing).

In the 'Business Analysis' Section, the report allows 'custom query' on different businesses, but this requires edit access of the report, and the link above only grants you view access.
If you want to try out the feature, please contact me at `zzhu35@dons.usfca.edu`. To change the custom query parameter, enter the edit mode -> click on the target graph -> in DATA section, select a different business from the dropdown. Note here you can only change one graph's parameter at a time, so if you want to see the complete summary for a different business, you have to change all relevant graphs.
