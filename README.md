# Yelp Dataset Analysis With BigQuery & Data Studio


## Introduction
This is the personal project for CS686 Data Processing in Cloud. In this project, a series of data analysis are conducted based on Yelp's public dataset. The analysis
focused on three aspects: Yelp's development, businesses advertised on Yelp, and Yelp's users.

## Data Source
Data is from Yelp's public [dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset).

## Tools
In this project, [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) is used to conduct data analysis. 
[Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/navigation/reporting) is used to visualize data. 
Both tools are from [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).

## Report
This repo contains both the analysis report and the pdf version of the Data Studio report. 
You can access the data studio report with this [link](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/80025518-5668-4c47-bf95-c036206182af).

In the 'Business Analysis' Section, the report allows 'custom query' on different businesses, but this requires edit access of the report, and the link above only grants you view access.
